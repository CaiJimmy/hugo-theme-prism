## The Rise of Transformers

The introduction of the Transformer architecture changed the landscape of NLP. Models like BERT and GPT-3 have shown that attention is indeed all you need.

## Beyond Supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning is gaining traction. It allows models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data, opening up new possibilities for AI.

## Ethical Considerations

As AI becomes more powerful, we must also consider the ethical implications. Bias in data, privacy concerns, and job displacement are issues that need to be addressed.

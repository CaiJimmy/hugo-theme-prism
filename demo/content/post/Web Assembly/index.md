WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It allows code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust to run on the web at near-native speed.

## Beyond JavaScript

While JavaScript is great, it has its limits. Wasm allows developers to port high-performance applications (like video editors and games) to the browser.

## How it Works

Wasm is designed to be a compilation target. You don't write Wasm directly; you compile your code to it.

## The Future

With features like Wasm Interface Types and WASI, WebAssembly is moving beyond the browser to become a universal runtime.

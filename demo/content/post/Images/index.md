To include images in your posts, use the standard Markdown syntax: `![Alt Text](image.jpg)`. This provides a simple way to embed visual content directly into your articles.

The Prism theme extends this functionality with built-in PhotoSwipe support. Clicking on any image in a post will open it in a responsive lightbox gallery, allowing readers to view high-resolution versions and navigate through all images in the post seamlessly.

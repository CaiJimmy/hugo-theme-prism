Rust has been voted the most loved programming language for several years in a row. But what makes it so special?

<!--more-->

## Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection

Rust's ownership model guarantees memory safety without needing a garbage collector. This means you get the performance of C++ with the safety of Java.

## Concurrency Made Easy

Data races are a thing of the past in Rust. The compiler ensures that if code compiles, it is free of data races.

## The Ecosystem

Cargo, Rust's package manager, is best-in-class. It makes managing dependencies, building, and testing your project a breeze.

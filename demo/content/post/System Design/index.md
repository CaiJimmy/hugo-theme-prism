## Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling

*   **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to your existing machine.
*   **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**: Adding more machines to your resource pool.

## Load Balancing

A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This ensures no single server bears too much load.

## Caching

Caching is a technique to store copies of data in a faster storage location. It's crucial for reducing latency and database load.
